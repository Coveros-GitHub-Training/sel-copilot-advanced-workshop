An AI-powered coding assistant that provides code suggestions, explanations, and development assistance directly within your IDE and throughout the GitHub platform.

**Access**: 
- **IDE**: Install GitHub Copilot extension from VS Code Extensions marketplace
- **GitHub.com**: Available throughout the platform (issues, pull requests, code views)

**Key Capabilities**: Code completion, chat assistance, autonomous coding, code review

### GitHub Copilot Chat
An interactive conversational interface that allows you to ask questions, request explanations, and get AI assistance with coding tasks. Available in VS Code, Visual Studio, and on GitHub.com.

**Access**:

- **GitHub.com**: Click the Copilot icon in the top-right corner of any page

**Key Capabilities**: Ask questions, explain code, generate implementations, refactor code

### Code Completions
Real-time AI-powered suggestions that appear as "ghost text" while you type in your IDE. These suggestions help you write code faster by predicting what you want to write next.

**Access**: 
- **IDE**: Automatically active when typing in code files (requires GitHub Copilot extension)
- **Accept**: Press `Tab` to accept a suggestion
- **Reject**: Press `Esc` or continue typing to dismiss

### Inline Chat
A chat interface that appears directly in your code editor at the cursor position, allowing you to ask questions or request changes without leaving your code.

**Access**: 
- **VS Code**: Press `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+I` (Mac) while in the editor
- **Alternative**: Right-click in the editor → Select "Copilot" → Choose "Start Inline Chat"

### Slash Commands
Special commands in Copilot Chat that start with `/` and trigger specific AI behaviors or actions.

**Access**: 
- **VS Code**: Type `/` in the Copilot Chat panel or Inline Chat
- **GitHub.com**: Type `/` in the Copilot Chat interface

**Examples**: 
- `/explain` - Explain selected code
- `/fix` - Suggest fixes for problems
- `/tests` - Generate test cases
- `/help` - Show available commands

### Chat Participants
Special prefixes that scope Copilot's responses to specific contexts or enable specialized capabilities.

**Access**: 
- **VS Code**: Type `@` in the Copilot Chat panel to see available participants
- **Usage**: Type `@participantname` followed by your question

**Examples**:
- `@workspace` - Provides context about your entire workspace
