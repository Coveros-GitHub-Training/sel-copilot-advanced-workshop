Let's get started and create something beautiful! 📷

## Setting up Your Development Environment

The first thing to do is to make sure that you create your own copy of this repository so that you can keep all of the work you do in this training.

This repository is set up as a template, so simply click the green `Use this template` button in the top right corner of the repository homepage to create your own.

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using GitHub Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Code"** button on the repository page
3. Select the **"Codespaces"** tab
4. Click **"Create codespace on main"** (or your current branch)
5. Wait for the codespace to build and start

The codespace will automatically:
- Configure GitHub Copilot and essential VS Code extensions
- Provide a fully configured development environment
- Install dependencies and start the development server in the `pixelperfect-gallery` directory

If you need to manually start the server:
```bash
cd pixelperfect-gallery
npm run dev
```

Access the application at the forwarded port URL provided in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

### Option B: Local Development

If you prefer to work locally:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js v18 or newer
   - npm (or yarn, pnpm, bun)
   - Git
   - Visual Studio Code (recommended)

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOURORGANIZATION>/<YOURREPOSITORYNAME>.git
   cd <YOURREPOSITORYNAME>/pixelperfect-gallery
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the application:**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Installing GitHub Copilot

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** (or your codespace)

2. **Install the GitHub Copilot extension:**
   - Click on the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
   - Search for **"GitHub Copilot"**
   - Click **Install** on the "GitHub Copilot" extension
   - Also install **"GitHub Copilot Chat"** if not automatically installed

3. **Sign in to GitHub:**
   - When prompted, sign in to your GitHub account
   - Authorize the GitHub Copilot extension

4. **Verify installation:**
   - Look for the GitHub Copilot icon in the bottom-right status bar
   - Open the Copilot Chat panel (click the chat icon in the left sidebar or use the keyboard shortcut)
   - You should see the chat interface ready to use

## Exploring the Application

Now that your environment is set up, let's explore what you'll be working with:

1. **View the running application:**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
   - Browse through the different pages (Home, Gallery, Upload, Admin)
   - Try interacting with features like photo filtering and the upload zone

2. **Explore the codebase structure:**
   ```
   pixelperfect-gallery/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── app/             # Next.js 15 App Router pages
   │   │   ├── page.tsx     # Home page
   │   │   ├── gallery/     # Gallery page
   │   │   ├── upload/      # Upload page
   │   │   └── admin/       # Admin dashboard
   │   ├── components/      # Reusable React components
   │   │   ├── ui/          # UI components
   │   │   ├── gallery/     # Gallery-specific components
   │   │   └── upload/      # Upload-specific components
   │   └── lib/             # Utility functions and mock data
   └── public/              # Static assets
   ```

3. **Key technologies in use:**
   - **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
   - **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
   - **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
   - **Framer Motion** - Animation library
   - **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives

## Verifying Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working correctly:

1. **Check that the application builds:**
   ```bash
   cd pixelperfect-gallery
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run the linter:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Verify GitHub Copilot is active:**
   - Open any `.tsx` file in the `pixelperfect-gallery/src/` directory
   - Start typing a comment like `// Function to calculate`
   - You should see Copilot suggestions appear (ghost text in gray)

## Summary

In this lab, you successfully:
- ✅ Set up your development environment
- ✅ Installed and configured GitHub Copilot
- ✅ Explored the Photo Gallery application
- ✅ Verified your setup is working correctly

You're now ready to dive into using GitHub Copilot to explore and enhance the PixelPerfect Gallery application!
