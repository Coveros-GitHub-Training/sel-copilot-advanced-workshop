## 💬 Step 2: Work Within Your Copilot Spaces

Now that your Spaces are configured, let's use them to accomplish specific goals. You'll work with each Space to see how the specialized context and instructions affect Copilot's responses.

### Instructions:

1. **Open your Security Assessment Space** from the Copilot Spaces dashboard

2. **Try these security-focused prompts:**

**Try one or more of these prompts:**

```
Analyze the UploadZone component for potential security vulnerabilities. What risks should we address?
```

```
How can we implement file type validation and size restrictions for uploaded images?
```

```
Review the mock data handling - are there any XSS vulnerabilities we should prevent?
```

```
What security headers should we configure in next.config.ts for this application?
```

```
Create a security checklist for the photo upload feature based on OWASP Top 10.
```

3. **Review the responses** - Notice how Copilot uses the security context and OWASP guidelines from your Space

4. **Have a multi-turn conversation** - Ask follow-up questions, request code examples, iterate on solutions

5. **Switch to your Documentation Hub Space:**
   - Return to your Spaces dashboard
   - Open the "Photo Gallery - Documentation Hub" Space

6. **Try these documentation-focused prompts:**

```
Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for the GalleryGrid component.
```

```
Create an API specification document for the photo data structure used in this application.
```

```
Write a component usage guide for the SectionContainer layout component.
```

```
Generate an architecture decision record (ADR) for using Next.js App Router in this project.
```

```
Create a getting started guide for new developers joining the photo gallery project.
```

7. **Compare the experiences:**
   - Notice how each Space has different expertise based on its instructions
   - The Security Space focuses on vulnerabilities and OWASP standards
   - The Documentation Space provides clear, well-structured documentation
   - Each Space uses only the relevant files you added to its context

## 📝 Step 3: Manage and Organize Your Spaces

As you create more Spaces, organization becomes important.

### Best Practices:

1. **Use clear, descriptive names:**
   - ✅ "Photo Upload - Security Hardening"
   - ❌ "Project A"

2. **Add comprehensive descriptions:**
   - Explain the Space's purpose
   - Include goals or success criteria
   - Note any specific constraints

3. **Keep instructions focused:**
   - Each Space should have a clear, specific purpose
   - Don't try to cover everything in one Space
   - Instructions should guide Copilot toward your specific needs

4. **Curate sources carefully:**
   - Add only relevant files and documentation
   - Too much context can dilute focus
   - Update sources as the project evolves

## 🔌 Step 4: Using Spaces from Your IDE with GitHub MCP

Now that you've created and worked with Spaces in the browser, let's integrate them into your daily workflow by accessing them directly from VS Code using the GitHub MCP server you configured in Lab 5.

### Why Use Spaces from Your IDE?

Accessing Copilot Spaces through the GitHub MCP server in your IDE provides:
- **Seamless Workflow**: No need to switch between browser and IDE
- **Context Aware**: Combine Space context with your current code
- **Faster Iteration**: Test and implement suggestions immediately
- **Integrated Experience**: Use Space expertise while actively coding

### Prerequisites:

Ensure you completed Lab 5 and have the GitHub MCP server configured in VS Code. If not, refer back to [Lab 5 - Step 4.2](Lab-5-Enhancing-Copilot.md#step-41-getting-the-github-mcp-server-up-and-running) for setup instructions.

### Step 4.1: Access Your Spaces via MCP

1. **Open VS Code** with your PixelPerfect Gallery project

2. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code

3. **List your Copilot Spaces:**
   ```
   Show me all my Copilot Spaces
   ```

4. **Review the list** - you should see both of your Spaces:
   - Photo Gallery - Security Assessment
   - Photo Gallery - Documentation Hub

### Step 4.2: Use Space Context in Your IDE

Now let's leverage your Spaces while working on code in VS Code.

#### Exercise A: Security Analysis from IDE

1. **Open the UploadZone component:**
   ```
   pixelperfect-gallery/src/components/upload/UploadZone.tsx
   ```

2. **In Copilot Chat, ask for security analysis using your Space context:**

   In a new chat session, switch to ask mode and ask Copilot the following:

   ```
   Using my "Photo Gallery - Security Assessment" Space for reference, analyze the currently open UploadZone component for security vulnerabilities. What specific improvements should I make?
   ```

3. **Review the suggestions** - Copilot should provide security-focused analysis informed by the OWASP context and instructions from your Space

4. **Ask follow-up questions** while staying in your Space context:
   ```
   Based on the Security Assessment Space, what file type validation code should I add to this component?
   ```

#### Exercise B: Generate Documentation from IDE

1. **Open the GalleryGrid component:**
   ```
   pixelperfect-gallery/src/components/gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx
   ```

2. **Request documentation using your Documentation Hub Space:**

   In a new chat session, switch to agent mode and ask Copilot the following:

   ```
   Using my "Photo Gallery - Documentation Hub" Space, generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for this GalleryGrid component following the documentation template.
   ```

3. **Review and apply the documentation** - Notice how Copilot follows the documentation standards and templates from your Space

4. **Generate additional documentation:**

   Switch to ask mode and prompt the following:

   ```
   Using the Documentation Hub Space context, create a usage example for this component with all its props explained.
   ```

### 💡 MCP + Spaces Best Practices:

1. **Be Explicit**: Always mention which Space you want to use by name
   ```
   Using my "Space Name" Space, ...
   ```

2. **Combine Contexts**: Reference both the Space and current file
   ```
   Using my Security Space, analyze the current file for vulnerabilities
   ```

3. **Iterate Quickly**: Test suggestions immediately in your IDE
   - Make changes
   - Run the dev server
   - Ask follow-up questions

4. **Stay Focused**: Use the appropriate Space for each type of work
   - Security reviews → Security Assessment Space
   - Documentation → Documentation Hub Space
   - Switch as needed for different aspects

5. **Leverage Both Environments**:
   - Use Space in browser for deep exploration and research
   - Use Space via MCP in IDE for active development and iteration
   - Each has its strengths!

### 🎯 Challenge Exercise: Full Workflow Integration

Put it all together with this comprehensive exercise:

1. **In your IDE**, open `pixelperfect-gallery/src/app/upload/page.tsx`

2. **Use your Security Space** to identify security improvements:
   ```
   Using my Security Assessment Space, what security enhancements should be made to this upload page?
