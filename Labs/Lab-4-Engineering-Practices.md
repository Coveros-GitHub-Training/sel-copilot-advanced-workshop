## 📊 Step 3: Managing Model Usage and Costs

Understanding premium request usage and model costs is essential for optimizing your GitHub Copilot experience. GitHub Copilot offers different AI models—some with unlimited usage (0x models) and others that count against a monthly request allowance (premium models). Learning to monitor your usage, select the right model for each task, and manage costs effectively will help you work more efficiently. For comprehensive information about pricing structures, advanced monitoring strategies, cost optimization techniques, and model selection guidelines by task type, see the **[Premium Request Usage Guide](../References/Premium-Request-Usage.md)**.

### Step 3.1: Experiment with Model Switching

Different AI models excel at different tasks. Learning which models work best for specific scenarios helps you work more efficiently.

#### Available Models:

GitHub Copilot provides access to models from:
- **OpenAI** (GPT series)
- **Anthropic** (Claude series)
- **Google** (Gemini series)
- **Auto** - Automatically selects the best model for your task at a 10% discount
- **Others** (constantly evolving)

For current models: [Supported Models Documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models)

#### About Auto Model Selection:

The **Auto** option intelligently selects the most appropriate model for your specific task:
- **Cost Savings**: Automatically get a 10% discount on premium request usage
- **Smart Selection**: GitHub analyzes your prompt and selects the optimal model
- **Simplified Workflow**: No need to manually choose between models for different tasks
- **Best Practice**: Ideal when you're unsure which model is best suited for your task

When to use Auto:
- When you want cost optimization without manual model selection

## 📋 Step 4: Understanding Custom Instructions Hierarchy

Custom instructions are rules that apply to every Copilot interaction. Which instructions are used depends on the context (personal, repository, or organization level).

### Step 4.1: Instructions Hierarchy

#### Hierarchy Levels:

1. **Personal Instructions** (highest priority)
   - Your individual preferences across all repos
   - Set at: https://github.com/copilot

2. **Repository Instructions** (medium priority)
   - Project-specific requirements
   - File: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

3. **Organization Instructions** (lowest priority)
   - Company-wide standards
   - Set by org admins

#### ⚖️ Balancing Different Instruction Levels

**Personal Instructions**: Your individual preferences across all repositories
- How Copilot talks to you
- Outlining your coding style
- Comment and documentation preferences

**Repository Instructions**: Project-specific requirements (in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Project architecture patterns
- Specific libraries or frameworks to use
- Team coding standards

**Priority Order:**
1. Personal instructions (highest)
2. Repository instructions
3. Organization instructions (lowest)

When instructions conflict, higher priority ones take precedence.

### Step 4.2: Review Repository Instructions

1. **Open** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in this repository

2. **Notice how it defines:**
   - Project overview and architecture
   - Component patterns
   - Styling conventions
   - Development workflow

3. **Understand how these instructions:**
   - Automatically apply to all Copilot interactions
   - Guide code generation to follow project patterns
   - Maintain consistency across the codebase

#### Example Instructions in This Repo:

The copilot-instructions.md file includes:
- Project structure overview
- Component usage patterns
- Technology stack information
- Styling conventions
- Best practices for this specific project

These instructions help Copilot generate code that fits seamlessly into the existing codebase.

### Step 4.3: Auto-Generate Repository Instructions

Use the Copilot Chat "Generate Chat Instructions" feature to automatically create (or refine) the repository’s `copilot-instructions.md`, then compare and improve it.

1. Open Copilot Chat  
2. Click the gear icon (Configure Chat) → choose **Generate Chat Instructions**
3. Look through the changes that Copilot has suggested making to the instructions file
4. Accept the changes that you think add value to the instructions, and `Undo` the ones that don't

> Tip: You should repeat this process routinely to ensure that the instructions always stay up to date with the codebase. This ensures that Copilot gets the best context possible when working within your code.

## 💎 Step 5: Best Practices for Creating Effective Instruction Files

Creating high-quality instruction files is essential for maximizing Copilot's effectiveness in production environments. Well-crafted instructions help teams maintain consistency, enforce standards, and guide AI-assisted development.
