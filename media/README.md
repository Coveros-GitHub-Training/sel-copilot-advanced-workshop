# Media Assets

This folder contains images and media assets referenced in the lab instructions.

## Required Images

The following images are referenced in the lab exercises but need to be added:

- `next-page.png` - Navigation button to continue to next lab
- `install-github-copilot-extension.png` - Screenshot showing Copilot extension installation
- `evidence-that-copilot-extension-was-installed.png` - Screenshot confirming installation

## Adding Images

To add screenshots for your environment:

1. Take screenshots during your lab setup
2. Save them with the appropriate filenames in this directory
3. Images will automatically appear in the lab instructions

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB when possible)
- Use clear, readable screenshots
- Highlight important UI elements when helpful
